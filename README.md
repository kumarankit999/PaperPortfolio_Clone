## Introduction

In an increasingly digital world, having an online portfolio is crucial for displaying your skills and accomplishments. Inspired by Miranda's beautifully designed paper portfolio, we've recreated the same aesthetic and charm in a digital form. This repository holds the code and assets required to set up your own version of Miranda's paper portfolio.

## Features

- **Elegant Design:** The portfolio features a clean and minimalist design that emphasizes the content without distractions.
- **Responsive:** The portfolio is responsive and works seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Project Showcase:** Display your projects, artworks, or any other work samples in a visually appealing manner.
- **About Me:** Introduce yourself through a dedicated "About Me" section.
- **Contact Information:** Provide contact details so that visitors can easily get in touch with you.
- **Customization:** Easily customize the content, colors, and layout to suit your personal brand.

## Usage

   - For each project, create a new directory and include relevant images, descriptions, and links.

3. Customize styles:
